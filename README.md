# Comprehensive Health Prognosticator

This Web App was developed using the Python Flask Web Framework to predict various diseases. The models were trained on large datasets, and all the links for datasets and the Python notebooks used for model creation are provided below. The WebApp can predict the following diseases:

- Diabetes
- Breast Cancer
- Heart Disease
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease         | Accuracy                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Diabetes        | Machine Learning Model 98.25%  |
| Breast Cancer   | Machine Learning Model 98.25%  |
| Heart Disease   | Machine Learning Model 85.25%  |
| Kidney Disease  | Machine Learning Model 99%     |
| Liver Disease   | Machine Learning Model 78%     |

## Installation and Usage

### Steps to Run the WebApp Locally

1. **Download the files in the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-prognosticator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the downloaded folder and install all the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd health-prognosticator
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **After successful installation of all the dependencies, run the following command:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Dataset Links
